== Purpose

=== Data modeling

Information is stored and used as data in digital systems. Digital systems
rely on defined structures to store, retrieve and manipulate data in a
consistent manner.

A data model is a structured representation of the data that describes the
properties of the data, the relationships between different data elements, and
any rules or constraints that govern the data.

Data modeling is the process of creating a data model.

Many data modeling languages exist, each with its own syntax and semantics.

[example]
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a general-purpose modeling
language that can be used to model a wide variety of information.

[example]
EXPRESS is a data modeling language designed to represent information
requirements.

Commonly languages that define data models are called "conceptual modeling
languages".

While many data modeling languages are used to define data models in a way that is
independent of underlying technologies used, most data modeling languages do not
provide a way to define how data is represented in an information system.

For example, information models in UML are mostly used for diagramming and
documentation purposes, and do not provide a way to define how the data can be
accessed or used in programming languages.


=== Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a
format that can be stored or transmitted between systems. Typically, this
involves converting the data into a string of bytes that can be written to a
file or sent over a network.

Serialization formats are very important in allowing systems to exchange
structured information in an interoperable manner without loss of semantics.

[example]
Common serialization formats include JSON, XML, and YAML.

Serialization formats often come with a schema language that allows for the
definition of particular data structures that data needs to conform to.

[example]
XML Schema, JSON Schema, and YAML Schema represent the schema languages
for XML, JSON, and YAML, respectively.

Typically, languages that define serialization formats are called "schema
languages".

A conceptual model may be realized ("implemented") in multiple serialization
formats. For example, some standards define a conceptual model in UML and
provide manually-defined transformation rules to XML and JSON.


=== Access in programming languages

Information defined by conceptual data models and serialization schema languages
are not directly usable in a native manner in programming languages or APIs.

At the conceptual data model level, there is no direct mapping to programming
language constructs. For example, a UML class diagram does not directly map to a
Java class.

There are tools that attempt to generate code from UML models, yet the generated
code will require manual integration and intervention to be usable in software.

At the serialization schema language level, there is again no direct access
from the programming language to the schema language constructs. For example, a
JSON Schema does not directly map to a Java class. Typically developers will
write code that parses the schema and/or implement code to read and write data
in the format defined by the schema.

The lack of direct access to data models and serialization formats in
programming languages makes it difficult to work with structured data in a
consistent manner across different systems and technologies.


=== Interleaving conceptual modeling and serialization format modeling

Conceptual modeling focuses on the definition of the existence and
relationships of data elements.

Serialization data modeling focuses on low-level details of how data is
represented in a particular format.

For example, a conceptual model may define that a `Date` object has
`year`, `month`, `day` attributes, and each of them
are of an `Integer` type and potentially the numbering constraints for each
attribute, and that there are certain restrictions to what the attributes can be
at an attribute level (valid values of `month` range from 1 to 12),
or at the object level (only a leap year is allowed to have 29 days in February).
It does not specify how many bytes are to be used to represent an `Integer` or
how the `Date` object is to be written in a file.

A serialization data model (using a schema language) may define that a `Date`
object is represented as a sequence of 3 Integers, each representing the `year`,
the `month`, and the `day`, respectively, and that the `Integer` type is
represented as a 4-byte unsigned integer. While the schema language may support
value constraints that the `month` attribute must be between 1 and 12, it is
unlikely that the schema language supports object-level complex constraints such
as "only a leap year is allowed to have 29 days in February". Schema languages
typically do not have the expressive power to define such complex constraints.

This presents a conundrum for the data modeler, who needs to define the entire
structure and constraints, but also needs to decide where and how to define
constraints that may not be definable in a schema language. This complexity
explodes exponentially as the need for the same data to be represented in
additional schema languages arises.

How much of the constraints should be defined in the conceptual model? How much
of the data model constraints should be defined in the serialization schema
language? Do we need to define duplicated constraints in both the conceptual
model and the serialization schema language if allowed? This is a question that
haunts developers and data modelers alike.


=== Challenges in data interchange

==== General

Interchange of data between systems of a particular data model can be
challenging due to multiple factors.

==== Derivation of serialization formats from conceptual models

A successful, modern conceptual model is expected to support multiple
serialization formats, given the variety of modern systems and tech stack
components.

While it is possible to define a conceptual model in a data modeling language,
and then manually define transformation rules to convert the model into
serialization formats, this is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the transformation rules are not
always well-defined and may not be easily maintained. A change in the conceptual
model may require changes in multiple serialization formats, and it is difficult
to maintain synchronicity between the conceptual model and the serialization
formats.

The solution to this problem is to define a single source of truth for the data
model, and then automatically derive the serialization formats from the data
model.

Even with automatic derivation, there are additional concerns (which we shall
address later):

* Versioning: How do we version the data model and the serialization formats?
* Migration: How do we migrate data from one version of the data model to another?
* Interoperability: How do we ensure that data can be exchanged between systems
  that use different versions of the data model?
* Access: How do we work with different versions of the data model in a
  programming language?



==== Complexity

Modern technical stacks are composed of multiple systems that are built using
different technologies and data modeling languages.

Browser-based applications may use JSON to represent data, while server-side
applications may use XML. Databases may use SQL to define data structures, while
APIs may use JSON Schema to define data structures.


==== Model definition language incompatibility

Different data modeling languages have different syntax and semantics. This
makes it difficult to interchange data between systems that are defined using
different data modeling languages.

For example, a data model defined in UML may not be directly convertible to a
data model defined in EXPRESS.

When a schema language is used to define data structures, the schema language
itself may not be directly convertible to another schema language.

For example, an XML Schema may not be directly convertible to a JSON Schema.

Typical approaches used today include:

* create a transformation toolchain that convert serialized formats to a defined
serialization format, then use a codebase that can parse the defined
serialization format

* create a transformation toolchain that convert serialized formats to an
intermediary representation, and then use a codebase that reads that
intermediary representation.

Imagine that there are 5 serialization formats that need to be supported.

Neither of these approaches is ideal, as they require additional work to be
done, and may introduce errors in the transformation process.



==== Semantic incompatibility of conceptual modeling languages

===== General

Some modeling languages are at their core, incompatible with each other due to
their different foundational principles and structures.

===== Comparing UML and EXPRESS

Both UML and EXPRESS are conceptual modeling languages intended for general use.

However, some UML concepts are not directly mappable to EXPRESS concepts:

* A UML class can have "methods", but an EXPRESS `ENTITY` allows only validation
logic (via `WHERE`, `RULES`, or `FUNCTION`/`PROCEDURE`), which is declarative and
stateless.

* EXPRESS `SELECT` types (flexible polymorphic unions) have no direct UML
equivalent. UML generalizations or interfaces approximate `SELECT` but lose
EXPRESS's runtime validation semantics.


===== Comparing UML and RDF

UML is a class-based modeling language, while RDF is a graph-based modeling
language.

* The concept of encapsulation (private/public attributes) in UML is not supported in RDF.

* The property multiplicity constraints (e.g., 1..*) cannot be enforced in RDF.

* RDF applies graph-based relationships (arbitrary connections between resources)
that are incompatible with the hierarchical class/object structure used in UML.


===== Approach

It is clear that a direct mapping between certain conceptual model languages is
impossible without losing some semantics.

Some communities have attempted to define mappings between conceptual model
languages, which often become rather complex as re-implementations of the modeling
language in another language. The result is a loss of semantics, expressivity,
and deviation from the conventions, benefits, and usability of the modeling
language.

The solution to this problem is to take a common approach that works across
different conceptual modeling languages, and then define additional rules for
each language to supplement the common approach.


==== Conversion difficulties between serialization formats

===== General

Some serialization formats are not directly mappable to each other, due to the
differences in syntax and semantics between the formats.

This means that a document in one serialization format cannot be directly
converted to another serialization format without modification.

These features are critical in data representation and serialization contexts.

===== Comparing YAML Schema and JSON Schema

Though YAML Schema is derived from JSON Schema, there are differences between the
two serialization formats that make direct conversion difficult without
additional handling. These include:

* Content-level semantic differences

** Data type mismatches. YAML supports data types not native to JSON, such as
date-time, symbols, and binary data. As a result, a defined transform needs to
be implemented to round-trip these data types between YAML and JSON.
+
[example]
A value that is of date-time type in YAML does not have a direct equivalent in
JSON. Such value is likely to be represented as a string in JSON. In a round-trip
operation, the JSON-to-YAML transform needs to detect that the string is a
date-time value and convert it back to a date-time value in YAML.

* Serialization-level semantic differences

** YAML supports multi-line strings, while JSON does not. A multi-line string in
YAML can be represented using modifier symbols on keys (such as the `|` and `>`
characters), but these are serialization-level specifics that are not part of
the content model, and hence JSON would have no representation for them.
+
[example]
Given YAML content that uses one of these multi-line structures, a round-trip
between JSON and YAML would lose the multi-line structure and end up with a
single-line string in the YAML serialization.

** YAML supports anchors and references, while JSON does not. In YAML, it is
possible to define an anchor for a value and then reference that anchor
in another part of the YAML document in order to reuse the value. JSON does not
have a direct equivalent for this feature.
+
[example]
Given a YAML document that uses anchors and references, a round-trip between JSON
and YAML would lose the anchor and reference structure and end up with a
repeated value in the YAML serialization.

===== Comparing XML Schema (XSD) and JSON Schema

XML Schema (XSD) is also not directly mappable to JSON Schema as XSD provides
features that JSON Schema does not include, such as:

* Content-level semantic differences

** Data type mismatches. JSON Schema supports the data types of string, number,
object, array, boolean, and null, while XSD supports these data types and many
additional data types such as date, time, and duration.

** Namespace support. XSD supports the concept of namespaces, while JSON Schema
does not.

** Composing complex types. XSD offers the ability to define complex composite
types and allows those to be reused in multiple places in the schema. JSON
Schema does not have a direct equivalent for this feature.

** Value constraints. XSD supports placing constraints on string values using
regular expressions, but JSON Schema does not have a direct equivalent for this
feature.

** Serialization order and structural constraints. XSD allows for the definition
of element sequences, groups, choices, and unions. JSON Schema does not have a
direct equivalent for these features.

* Serialization-level semantic differences

** XML attributes. XSD allows for the definition of attributes on elements, while
JSON Schema does not have a direct equivalent for this feature.

** XML comments. XML allows comments in the schema, while JSON does not.

** XML processing instructions. XML allows processing instructions in the schema,
while JSON does not.

** XML entities. XML allows entities in the schema, while JSON does not. This
means that an XML file with entities will likely be represented as a string in
JSON, causing a round-trip operation from XML to lose the entity structure.

** XML CDATA sections. XML allows CDATA sections in the schema, while JSON only
has one type of string. This means that an XML file with CDATA sections will
likely be represented as a string in JSON, causing a round-trip operation from
XML to lose the CDATA structure.

===== Approach

The solution to this problem is to define a common approach that works across
different serialization formats, and then define additional rules for each
format to supplement the common approach.


=== Goals

LutaML is a system that aims to simplify users to easily define data models and
work with information that conforms to those data models.

The goal of LutaML is to allow these steps to flow seamlessly:

. Define a platform-independent data model in a human-readable format. (LutaML
language)
. Allow the data model to be directly useable in a programming language. (LutaML
runtime)
. Allow the data model to be expressed in a serialization schema language.
(LutaML language)
. Allow the data model to be directly serializable to a serialization format.
(LutaML runtime)
. Support the loading of data from a serialization format into a programming
language. (LutaML runtime)
. Allow importing a serialization schema language to define a data model.
(LutaML runtime)
. Allow the conversion of serialization formats to another through the data
model. (LutaML runtime)


The LutaML language provides a way to represent structured data in a human-readable
format.

== Principles

The principles of LutaML are:

. Provide a human-readable syntax for defining data models.
. Consistent language constructs.
. The language should be simple and easy to understand, and does not require
specialized knowledge for particular serialization formats unless advance
features are needed.
. Support modular reuse of definitions across files.
. Support instance representation of data models.


== Core syntax

The core syntax of LutaML is based on the following constructs:

* primitive values
* command
* argument
* block
* comment

=== Primitive values

Primitive values are the basic building blocks of LutaML.

All primitive types have names that start with uppercase.

LutaML supports the following primitive values:

* `String` (e.g., `"high-fire"`),
* `Integer` (e.g., `42`).
* `Float` (e.g., `3.5`),
* `Boolean` (e.g., `true`),
* `Time_without_date` (e.g., `12:00:00`),
* `Date-time` (e.g., `2024-01-01T12:00:00+00:00`)
* `Time` (e.g., `2024-01-01T12:00:00+00:00`)
* `Decimal` (e.g., `3.14159`)
* `Hash` (e.g., `{ "key": "value" }`)


=== Command, arguments and blocks

A command is a keyword that represents an action or a declaration.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
{command} {*argument} {*block}
----

Where,

`{command}`:: the command keyword
`{*argument}`:: zero or more arguments
`{*block}`:: an optional blocks

An argument is a string, which can be a primitive value or a reference to another
object.

A block is delimited by curly braces and provides a context for inner commands.

[example]
====
This example shows the `class` command that takes an argument `Studio` to
represent the name of the class.

[source,lml]
----
class Studio
----
====

[example]
====
This example shows the `class` command that takes an argument `Studio` as its
name with a block given, where it contains an attribute.

[source,lml]
----
class Studio {
  attribute ...
}
----
====

=== Comment

A comment is a line of text that is ignored by the processor.

==== Single-line comment

A single-line comment is also called a "tail comment", a comment that appears at
the end of a line.

The `//` character sequence can appear at the beginning of a line or after
whitespace.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
// {text}
or
{expression} // {text}
----

Where,

`{text}`:: the comment text

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
// This is a comment
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class Studio { // This is a comment
  attribute location, String
}
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
// TODO: attributes <1>
class Ceramic {
  // Write docs <2>
  + glazeType: GlazeType // Glaze type <3>
}
----

<1> A line beginning with `//` is a comment.
<2> A line beginning with whitespaces followed by `//` is a comment.
<3> A line with `//` is a tail comment: the text after `//` is a comment.
====


==== Multi-line comment

Comments can also be multi-line.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
/* {text} */
----

Where,

`{text}`:: the comment text

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
----
====


==== Definition

The `definition` block is used to define a multiline description for a class.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
definition {text}
// or
definition {block}
----

Where,

`{text}`:: the description text
`{block}`:: description text block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
definition "Non-reflective finish"
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
definition {
  Non-reflective finish
}
----
====

Content within the block is considered to be multi-line textual content.
No commands are available within the block.

[example]
.Declaring a class named "Ceramic" with a description
====
[source]
----
class Ceramic {
  definition {
    This class represents a ceramic object.
  }
}
----
====




== Representable objects

=== General

LutaML supports the following constructs.


=== Model / Package

The `models` construct is used to define a collection of classes and enums.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
models {name} {block}
----

Where,

`{name}`:: the name of the model package
`{*block}`:: an optional block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
models Ceramics {
  enum FiringProfile { values { "low", "medium", "high" } }

  class CeramicTile {
    attribute dimensions, float { cardinality 2 }  // [length, width]
    attribute firing_profile, FiringProfile
  }
}
----
====

Within the block, the following commands are available:

* `class`
* `enum`
* `description`


=== Class

The `class` construct is used to define a class which is a collection of
attributes.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
class {name} {block}
----

Where,

`{name}`:: the name of the class
`{*block}`:: an optional block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class Studio {
  attribute location, String {
    description "Location of the studio"
  }
  attribute potter, String {
    description "Name of the potter"
  }
  attribute kiln, String {
    description "Type of kiln used"
  }
}
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class TemperatureWithUnit {
  attribute value, Float {
    description "Temperature value"
  }
  attribute unit, String {
    description "Unit of temperature"
  }
}
----
====

Class attributes can be restricted to a specific set of values using the `values` command.

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class GlazeTechnique {
  attribute name, String {
    values { "Celadon", "Raku", "Majolica" }
  }
}
----

Or

[source,lml]
----
enum GlazeTechniqueEnum {
  value "Celadon"
  value "Raku"
  value "Majolica"
}
class GlazeTechnique {
  attribute name, String {
    values GlazeTechniqueEnum
  }
}
----
====

It is possible to also define values with object instances.

[example]
====
// [source,ruby]
// ----
// class Ceramic < Lutaml::Model::Base
include Lutaml::Model::Serializable
//   attribute :type, :string
//   attribute :firing_temperature, :integer
// end

// class CeramicCollection < Lutaml::Model::Base
include Lutaml::Model::Serializable
//   attribute :featured_piece,
//             Ceramic,
//             values: [
//               Ceramic.new(type: "Porcelain", firing_temperature: 1300),
//               Ceramic.new(type: "Stoneware", firing_temperature: 1200),
//               Ceramic.new(type: "Earthenware", firing_temperature: 1000),
//             ]
// end
// ----

[source,lml]
----
class Ceramic {
  attribute type, String
  attribute firing_temperature, Integer
}

class CeramicCollection {
  attribute featured_piece, Ceramic {
    values {
      instance Ceramic {
        type = "Porcelain"
        firing_temperature = 1300
      }
      instance Ceramic {
        type = "Stoneware"
        firing_temperature = 1200
      }
      instance Ceramic {
        type = "Earthenware"
        firing_temperature = 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

Within the block, the following commands are available:

* `attribute`
* `description`


=== Attribute

The `attribute` construct is used to define an attribute of a class.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
attribute {name}, {type} {block}
----

Where,

`{name}`:: the name of the attribute
`{type}`:: the type of the attribute
`{*block}`:: an optional block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
attribute location, String {
  description "Location of the studio"
}
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
attribute dimensions, Float {
  description "Dimensions of the ceramic piece"
}
----
====

An attribute can have a cardinality constraint when it is a collection.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
attribute {name}, {type} { cardinality {min}..{max} }
----

Where,

`{min}`:: the minimum number of values
`{max}`:: the maximum number of values


[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
attribute batch_ids, String { cardinality 0..n }
----
====

An attribute can have a values constraint.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
attribute {name}, {type} { values {value1, value2, ...} }
----

Where,

`{value1, value2, ...}`:: the values that the attribute can take, or an Enum.


[example]

[source,lml]
----
attribute firing_profile, FiringProfile {
  values { "low", "medium", "high" }
}
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
enum FiringProfileEnum {
  value "low"
  value "medium"
  value "high"
}
class FiringProfile {
  attribute firing_profile, FiringProfile {
    values FiringProfileEnum
  }
}
----
====


An attribute that accepts a string value accepts value validation using regular
expressions.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
attribute {name}, String { pattern {regex} }
----

Where,

`{regex}`:: the regular expression to validate the string value

[example]
====
In this example, the `color` attribute takes hex color values such as `#ccddee`.

A regular expression can be used to validate values assigned to the attribute.
In this case, it is `/^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$/`.

[source,lml]
----
attribute color, String {
  pattern /\A#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})\z/
}
----
====

An attribute can have a default value using the `default` option.
The `default` option can be set to a value or a lambda that returns a value.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
attribute {name}, {type} { default: {value} }
----

.Using the `default` option to set a default value for an attribute
[example]
====
// [source,ruby]
// ----
// class Glaze < Lutaml::Model::Base
include Lutaml::Model::Serializable
//   attribute :color, :string, default: -> { 'Clear' }
//   attribute :temperature, :integer, default: -> { 1050 }
// end
// ----

Within the block, the following commands are available:

* `map_element`
* `map_attribute`



=== JSON

LutaML supports the serialization of data models to JSON.



== Instance representation

=== Instance collection

Instances are representations of classes with values assigned to their
attributes as a collection.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
instances {name} {block}
----

Where,

`{name}`:: the name of the instance
`{*block}`:: an optional block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
instances "Studios" {
  instance Studio {
    location = "Paris"
    potter = "Marie"
    kiln = "Electric"
  }

  instance Studio {
    location = "Berlin"
    potter = "Hans"
    kiln = "Gas"
  }
}
----

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
instances "Tiles" {
  instance "square" CeramicTile {
    dimensions = [30.5, 30.5]
    firing_profile = "high"
  }

  instance "circle" CeramicTile {
    dimensions = [20.5, 20.5]
    firing_profile = "medium"
  }
}

Within the block, the following commands are available:

* `instance`

== Instance

An `instance` construct is used to define an instance of a class.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
instance {name} {block}
----

Where,

`{name}`:: the name of the instance
`{*block}`:: an optional block

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class Studio {
  attribute location, String
  attribute potter, String
  attribute kiln, String
}

instance "Studio" {
  location = "Paris"
  potter = "Marie"
  kiln = "Electric"
}
----
====

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
class CeramicTile {
  attribute dimensions, Float { cardinality 2 }
  attribute firing_profile, FiringProfile
}

instance "square" CeramicTile {
  dimensions = [30.5, 30.5]
  firing_profile = "high"
}
----
====

Within the block, the following commands are available:

* attributes of the class
* `description`





=== Value type

==== References

References are used to link instances together.

Syntax:

[source,lml]
----
ref:(path)
----

Where,

`{path}`:: the path to the instance

[example]
====
[source,lml]
----
instances Glazes {
  GlazeFormula "blue_matte" {
    components = ["silica", "cobalt"]
  }

  CeramicTile "tile_002" {
    glaze = ref:(Glazes.blue_matte)
  }
}
----

== Reuse and referencing

Lutaml supports modularity through external file inclusions.

=== External file inclusion
Use `require` to import definitions from other files.

[source,lml]
----
require "materials.lml"
instances Tiles {
  Materials::CeramicTile "tile_001" {
    dimensions = [30.0, 30.0]
    firing_profile = "medium"
  }

  Materials::CeramicTile "tile_002" {
    dimensions = [40.0, 60.0]
    firing_profile = "high"
  }
}
----

=== Internal references

Link instances using `ref:`.

[source,lml]
----
instances Production {
  GlazeFormula "gloss_blue" { ... }

  CeramicTile "tile_001" {
    glaze = ref:(GlazeFormula.gloss_blue)
  }
}
----

=== Namespacing
Class names are scoped to their model (e.g., `Materials::CeramicTile`).

== Validation rules

=== Attribute constraints
1. Mandatory fields (`cardinality 1`) must be populated.
2. Values must match the declared type (e.g., `float` for `thickness`).

=== Class constraints
1. Unique names within a model.
2. Attribute names unique within a class.

=== Reference validity
- `ref:` must resolve to a valid instance path.
- Circular references are invalid.

== Examples

=== Ceramic product definition
[source,lml]
----
models Ceramics {
  enum FiringProfile { values { "low", "medium", "high" } }

  class CeramicTile {
    attribute dimensions, float { cardinality 2 }  // [length, width]
    attribute firing_profile, FiringProfile
  }
}

instances Tiles {
  Ceramics::CeramicTile "tile_001" {
    dimensions = [30.5, 30.5]
    firing_profile = "high"
  }
}
----

=== Glaze formula reference
[source,lml]
----
instances Glazes {
  GlazeFormula "blue_matte" {
    components = ["silica", "cobalt"]
  }

  CeramicTile "tile_002" {
    glaze = ref:(Glazes.blue_matte)
  }
}
